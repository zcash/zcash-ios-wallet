# zcash-ios-wallet

iOS wallet using the Zcash iOS SDK that is maintained by core developers.

There are some known areas for improvement:

- Traffic analysis, like in other cryptocurrency wallets, can leak some privacy
  of the user.
- The wallet might display inaccurate transaction information if it is connected
  to an untrustworthy server.

See the [Wallet App Threat
Model](https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/wallet_threat_model.html)
for more information about the security and privacy limitations of the wallet.

## Prerequisites
* make sure you can build ZcashLightClientKit Demo Apps successfully

# Building the App
1. Clone the project, make sure you have the latest Xcode Version

2. Create `env-vars.sh file` at `${SRCROOT}` [See Instructions](https://github.com/zcash/ZcashLightClientKit#setting-env-varsh-file-to-run-locally)

3. make sure that your environment has the variable `ZCASH_NETWORK_ENVIRONMENT` set to`MAINNET`or `TESTNET`.

4. Navigate to the wallet directory where the `Podfile` file is located and run `pod install`

5. open the `wallet.xcworkspace` file

6. locate the `.params` files that are missing in the project and include them at the specified locations

7. build and run on simulator.


## Troubleshooting

### No network environment....
if you see this message when building:
```No network environment. Set ZCASH_NETWORK_ENVIRONMENT to MAINNET or TESTNET```
make sure your dev environment has this variable set before the build starts. *DO NOT CHANGE IT DURING THE BUILD PROCESS*.

If the variable was properly set *after* you've seen this message, you will need to either a) set it manually on the pod's target or b) doing a clean pod install and subsequent build.

#### a) setting the flag manually
1. on your workspace, select the Pods project
2. on the Targets pane, select ZcashLightClientKit
3. go to build settings
4. scroll down to see ZCASH_NETWORK_ENVIRONMENT and complete with TESTNET or MAINNET
